Here is the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r2j276/kyle_rittenhouse_is_the_worst_white_supremacist/) to my favorite Reddit. I found this thread particularly interesting from the title alone, but what made it even funnier is the fact that none of the comments were related at all.

Here is an image of the ![thread](thread.jpg).

## Score
I believe I deserve a 26/30 because I was able to complete all the required tasks (6 tasks and github repo). On top of the required tasks, I got 1000 valid comments. I did not complete any of the other optional tasks.
